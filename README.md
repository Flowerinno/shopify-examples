# I'm just a gay exploring Shopify

The main goal is to simplify the process of learning Shopify's Polaris design system by providing examples and code snippets. I will be adding more examples as I explore more of the design system.
Most of the examples assume that you have a basic understanding of React (Remix), GraphQL.
All examples are basic and are meant to be a starting point for you to build upon.

## Available Examples

```
Polaris:
  - IndexTable

GraphQL API:
  - Products
```

### The list will be populated as I explore more, stay tuned!
